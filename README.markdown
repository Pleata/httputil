HTTP Utility Package
====================

Getting Started
---------------

Install:

    goinstall github.com/crazy2be/httputil

Import:

    import "github.com/crazy2be/httputil"

Use:

    httputil.ServeFileOnly(rw, r, path)

What to Use it For
------------------
HTTP functionality that really aught to be in the http package, but isn't for whatever reason. Designed to supplement the existing http package.

More will be added as I find myself needing extra functionality.
